/**
 * Represents the minimal communication structure that can be persisted

 *
 * <p>A {@code Record} defines the fundamental unit of interaction used by
 * the Communication API. It provides access to the record key, which uniquely
 * identifies the data within the underlying database.</p>
 *
 * <p>This abstraction is intentionally minimal and does not impose assumptions
 * about the internal structure, schema, or semantics of the stored data.
 * Specialized NoSQL models such as key-value, document, graph, column-family,
 * time-series, and vector databases may extend this interface according to
 * their specific capabilities and behaviors.</p>
 *
 * <p>The type and semantics of the key are determined by the underlying
 * database and provider implementation.</p>
