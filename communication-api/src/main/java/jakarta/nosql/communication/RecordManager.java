/**
 * Defines the minimal communication contract for managing records within
 * a NoSQL database.
 *
 * <p>A {@code RecordManager} provides basic lifecycle operations for
 * interacting with records, including insertion, update, retrieval,
 * and deletion. This interface represents the common operational
 * foundation shared across NoSQL database models.</p>
 *
 * <p>The visibility, durability, consistency, and execution timing of
 * operations defined by this interface are determined by the underlying
 * database implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Communication API is intentionally minimal and does not define
 * query languages, traversal semantics, aggregation models, or other
 * database-specific capabilities. Specialized communication models may
 * extend this interface to provide additional behaviors according to
 * the characteristics of the underlying database.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations are expected to preserve the native behavior and
 * semantics of the target NoSQL database.</p>
