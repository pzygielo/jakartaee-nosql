/**
 * Provides the key-value communication model for Jakarta NoSQL.
 *
 * <p>The key-value communication model represents interaction
 * with NoSQL databases based on the association of a unique
 * key to a value. It focuses on fundamental operations such
 * as storing, retrieving, replacing, and removing data using
 * a key as the primary access mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <p>This model defines a minimal and extensible communication
 * structure aligned with the native behavior of key-value
 * databases. It intentionally avoids introducing query
 * abstractions, traversal semantics, aggregation models,
 * or relational-style operations beyond key-based access.</p>
 *
 * <p>The key-value model commonly represents some of the
 * simplest and most scalable NoSQL storage systems, where
 * data access is optimized around direct key resolution,
 * distributed partitioning, replication, and high-throughput
 * operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The APIs defined in this package provide a low-level
 * communication layer designed to integrate with higher-level
 * frameworks, mapping technologies, provider implementations,
 * and Jakarta specifications.</p>
 *
 * <p>The design supports extensibility to accommodate
 * variations across key-value databases, including capabilities
 * such as expiration policies, atomic operations, distributed
 * consistency strategies, replication models, batching
 * optimizations, or provider-specific behaviors. The
 * availability and semantics of these capabilities are
 * determined by the underlying database implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>This model is part of the Jakarta NoSQL Communication API
 * and follows its principles of optional adoption, minimal
 * abstraction, extensibility, and preservation of native
 * database semantics. Implementations may extend or adapt
 * this model to support provider-specific capabilities.</p>
 *
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * BucketManagerFactory factory = ...
 *
 * BucketManager manager = factory.get("users");
 *
 * KeyValueRecord record = ...
 *
 * manager.put(record);
 *
 * Optional<KeyValueRecord> result =
 *         manager.findByKey("user:10");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In summary, the key-value communication model defines a
 * minimal, low-level, and extensible foundation for
 * interacting with key-value NoSQL systems while preserving
 * their native operational characteristics.</p>
