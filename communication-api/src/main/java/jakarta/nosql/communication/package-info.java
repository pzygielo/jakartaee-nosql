/**
 * Provides the Communication API for Jakarta NoSQL.
 *
 * <p>The Communication API defines a minimal and extensible
 * foundation for interacting with NoSQL databases while
 * preserving the native semantics and operational behavior
 * of the underlying database implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Communication API focuses on low-level lifecycle
 * operations such as storing, retrieving, replacing,
 * and removing data structures according to the semantics
 * and capabilities of the target database.</p>
 *
 * <p>The APIs defined in this package intentionally avoid
 * introducing query languages, traversal semantics,
 * aggregation models, relational abstractions,
 * transactional guarantees, or provider-specific behaviors
 * beyond the minimal communication contracts defined by
 * Jakarta NoSQL.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Communication API is intentionally minimal and
 * designed to support extensibility according to the
 * capabilities, consistency models, serialization
 * strategies, and operational characteristics of the
 * underlying database implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Depending on the provider implementation, communication
 * operations may support capabilities such as distributed
 * replication, eventual consistency, partitioning,
 * batching optimizations, append-oriented persistence,
 * provider-defined metadata, or provider-specific
 * communication behaviors.</p>
 *
 * <p>Providers may configure communication managers using
 * mechanisms such as Java properties, environment variables,
 * dependency injection, configuration files,
 * provider-defined defaults, or provider-specific
 * communication contexts.</p>
 *
 * <p>In summary, the Communication API defines a minimal,
 * low-level, provider-neutral, and extensible foundation
 * for integrating communication models within Jakarta
 * NoSQL.</p>
