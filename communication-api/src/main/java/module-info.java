/**
 * Defines the Jakarta NoSQL Communication API module.
 *
 * <p>This module provides a minimal and extensible
 * communication foundation for interacting with NoSQL
 * databases while preserving the native semantics and
 * operational behavior of the underlying database
 * implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Communication API focuses on low-level lifecycle
 * operations for storing, retrieving, replacing,
 * and removing data structures according to the
 * capabilities and characteristics of the target database.</p>
 *
 * <p>The APIs exposed by this module are designed to support
 * extensibility, provider neutrality, and interoperability
 * across different NoSQL communication models.</p>
 *
 * <p>Provider implementations may support capabilities such
 * as distributed replication, eventual consistency,
 * partitioning, batching optimizations,
 * provider-defined serialization strategies,
 * graph connectivity semantics, or provider-specific
 * communication behaviors.</p>
